OKCoin Api - at the moment development is focused on the RESTful API provided by OKCoin and will eventually move to support websockets.

Must contain two environment variables to test: OKCOIN_API_KEY and OKCOIN_SECRET_KEY.

Add them to your .bash_profile or .bashrc file in the following way:

    export OKCOIN_API_KEY=your okcoin api key goes here
    export OKCOIN_SECRET_KEY=your okcoin secret key goes here
